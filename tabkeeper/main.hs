{-
 - Want: a function that gives me a link (a string)
 - pulls the string (randomly) from a collection of strings 
 -   - maybe a hashmap and a random number?
 -   -- shuffle the hashmap after picking? 
 -
 -   - or a list and just split it, zip the sublists, append
 -   --- do that a couple times, like shuffling cards 
 -
 -   after pulling the string
 -   should have it removed from the collection of links 
 -   and stored in a different list of links already viewed
 -
 -   want to be able to undo or re-merge links into one collection
 -
 -
 - protip:
 - ghc --make main & ./main
 - -- or --
 - runhaskell main.hs

 main = do putStrLn "whole lot of nothing going on here"
