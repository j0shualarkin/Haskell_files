# Weird name 

This is a collection of files that I made whenever I decide[d] to work in the land of ```.hs```

Some are in better shape than others, and it's not particularly a goal to fix those that leave something to be desired. 

311 is a programming languages class and the files in this folder are haskell renditions of some of the assignments.

DS is a collection of implementations of data structures. 

Tabkeeper is a work in progress. It has it's own readme.
